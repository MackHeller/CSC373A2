Every time we add a new vertex we recompute the minimum spanning tree using kruskal's algorithm 
to compute the new minimum spanning tree. We first generate all the edges connecting the new vertex to
all the other vertices in the graph excluding edges that are larger than the smallest edge we've seen
so far. Then we recalculate the minimum spanning tree over all the newly 
generated edges and the edges in the previous minimum spanning tree.

3. For our algorithm, if we have need V vertices, we need to run kruskal's algorithms V times and since
kruskal's algorithm runs in E log V and since we have at most 2V edges in the graph at any time, we can say that 
the algorithm is in O(v^2logV)
